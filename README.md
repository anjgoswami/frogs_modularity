## Data and code for Bardua et al. 2020. Evolutionary integration of the frog cranium. Evolution. 

Including:

Bardua_2020_raw_landmarks_curves_present_regions:	Raw landmark and subsampled curve data for regions that are always present in the anuran skull, for 172 specimens. 

EMMLi_module_hypotheses:	Module hypotheses tested with EMMLi for the anuran skull dataset

EMMLi_network_graph_layout_19_regions:	Network graph layout for use in visualising outputs from EMMLi and CR

Tree_172species:	Phylogeny of 172 anuran species, modified from Jetz and Pyron 2018

Region_information_N_172:	Region information for 172 anuran specimens (detailing absent regions)

newEmmliFunctions:	Additional functions for use in R. To use, simply source this file before use (e.g. source("./newEmmliFunctions.R"))

EMMLi_subsampling_for_unequal_datasets:	This R code is provided as an example of how to run EMMLi when comparing two unequally-sized 
datasets. The larger dataset can iteratively be subsampled down to the size of the smaller dataset.

Demonstrating_negligible_merging_binding:	This R code is provided as an example of how to create negligible regions, and then how to combine negligible region data with present region data.
